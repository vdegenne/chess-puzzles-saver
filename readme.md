# Chess Puzzles Saver (lichess & chess.com)

- <a href="https://vdegenne.github.io/chess-puzzles-saver/">Access the application here</a>

- Then click on *Add Puzzle* and copy/paste the link of the puzzle page (lichess or chess.com link).
- Choose a name (default to the id of the link)
- Add more puzzles
- Finally when you have a good list you can push *r* on your keyboard to open a random puzzle.

## Motivation

Resolving new puzzles is a good exercice to progress at chess. Both lichess and chess.com have puzzles but no feature to easily save them. Sometimes some puzzles can be difficult and you may want to solve the puzzles later again for training your weaknesses. This micro webapp let you make a list of saved puzzles and play them randomly again.

## Advices

- The longer the list the harder but the better, it's by training pattern recognition that you can make new improvements.
- You can place your hand to press ctrl+w (to close a tab) and ctrl+r (play random), this way you can quickly close and open random puzzles for intense training.
- Here's a list of few puzzles, copy/paste this list in the input from "import list" to try the app: 

```[{"name":"71205","link":"https://lichess.org/training/71205"},{"name":"107665","link":"https://lichess.org/training/107665"},{"name":"19588","link":"https://lichess.org/training/19588"},{"name":"104683","link":"https://lichess.org/training/104683"},{"name":"88708","link":"https://lichess.org/training/88708"},{"name":"46567","link":"https://lichess.org/training/46567"},{"name":"102695","link":"https://lichess.org/training/102695"},{"name":"66534","link":"https://lichess.org/training/66534"},{"name":"33454","link":"https://lichess.org/training/33454"},{"name":"116192","link":"https://lichess.org/training/116192"},{"name":"79128","link":"https://lichess.org/training/79128"}]```
